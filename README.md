Animal Shelter Database

This project is designed to manage an animal shelter's database, keeping track of various animals such as cats and dogs. It allows for creating reports on the total number of animals, their details, and their health status.

Project Structure:

- Animal.cpp: Contains the implementation for the base `Animal` class, which is used to represent the general properties of animals.
- Animal.h: The header file that defines the `Animal` class and its members.
- Cat.cpp: Contains the implementation for the `Cat` class, which inherits from `Animal`.
- Cat.h: The header file that defines the `Cat` class and its unique attributes.
- Dog.cpp: Contains the implementation for the `Dog` class, which inherits from `Animal`.
- Dog.h: The header file that defines the `Dog` class and its unique attributes.
- main.cpp: The main entry point for the program, which manages the creation of animals and generates reports.
- animalReport.txt & animalReports.txt: These text files contain sample reports generated by the program. They include the total number of animals created, detailed information about each animal, and separate lists for cats and dogs.

Reports Example:
- Total Animals Created: 14
- Number of Cats: 8
- Number of Dogs: 4

Sample Cat Entry:
Hi, I'm Morris, I'm a Cat and I'm 9 years old. My weight is: 3 lbs. I'm UNKNOWN and I am yellow. The status of my health is: good and I Moan.

Getting Started:

To run this project, compile the source files using a C++ compiler. You can use the following commands:

1. Compile: g++ -o AnimalShelter main.cpp Animal.cpp Cat.cpp Dog.cpp

2. Run the program: ./AnimalShelter

Future Enhancements:

- Add functionality for other types of animals.
- Implement a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
